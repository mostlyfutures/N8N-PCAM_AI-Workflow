# Autonomous PCAM Programming Assistant - N8N Workflow

## Overview

This N8N workflow implements a sophisticated autonomous programming assistant that uses **PCAM (Persona, Context, Action, Metrics) decomposition** to analyze user prompts and automatically execute programming tasks without requiring manual confirmation for each command.

## Key Features

### 🤖 PCAM Decomposition Engine
- **Persona Analysis**: Identifies the role (autonomous programmer) and required expertise
- **Context Analysis**: Processes user prompts, project paths, and execution parameters  
- **Action Analysis**: Categorizes programming intentions (analysis, creation, modification, testing, deployment)
- **Metrics Analysis**: Calculates complexity scores, risk levels, and automation confidence

### 🔒 Autonomous Safety System
- **Command Filtering**: Only executes pre-approved safe commands
- **Risk Assessment**: Blocks potentially dangerous operations
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuous audit logging and integrity checks
- **Autonomous Threshold**: Only proceeds when confidence > 50%

### 🏗️ Project Structure Intelligence
- **Multi-Language Detection**: Supports JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby
- **Package Manager Recognition**: npm, pip, cargo, maven, bundler detection
- **Build System Analysis**: webpack, vite, make, gradle identification
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic dependency installation and updates

### ⚡ Autonomous Execution Engine
- **No Manual Confirmation**: Executes approved commands automatically
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple command execution streams
- **Result Aggregation**: Intelligent analysis of execution outcomes
- **Project Reconstruction**: Automatic improvements based on analysis

```

## Usage

### 1. Deploy the Workflow
1. Import `autonomous-pcam-programming-workflow.json` into your N8N instance
2. Activate the workflow
3. Note the webhook URL provided by N8N

### 2. Send Programming Requests

**POST** to your webhook URL with JSON payload:

```json

  "prompt": "Analyze my React project and optimize the build configuration",
  "projectPath": "/path/to/your/project"
}
```

### 3. Supported Prompt Categories

- "Review dependencies for security issues" 
- "Examine performance bottlenecks"

#### Creation Commands  
- "Create a new React component"
- "Build API endpoints for user management"
- "Generate test files for existing modules"

#### Modification Commands
- "Refactor the authentication system"
- "Update dependencies to latest versions"
- "Optimize database queries"

#### Testing Commands
- "Run all unit tests"
- "Execute integration test suite" 
- "Validate code coverage"

#### Deployment Commands
- "Build and deploy to staging"
- "Create Docker container"
- "Publish npm package"

## Safety Features

### Approved Safe Commands
```bash
# File Operations
ls, pwd, find, grep, cat, head, tail, wc

# Git Operations  
git status, git log, git diff, git branch

# Package Managers
npm list, npm run, npm test, npm install
pip list, pip install, python -m
cargo check, cargo test, cargo build

# Safe File Creation
mkdir -p, touch, echo

# Containerization
docker build, docker run --rm
```

### Blocked Dangerous Commands
```bash
# File Destruction
rm -rf, rm -f, del /f, format

# System Modifications
sudo, chmod 777, chown

# Destructive Git Operations
git push --force, git reset --hard

# Package Removal
npm uninstall, pip uninstall
```

### Autonomous Execution Criteria
- Command must match approved safe patterns
- No dangerous keywords detected
- Automation confidence > 50%
- Project structure analysis successful
- Safety checks passed

## Response Format

### Successful Autonomous Execution
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Autonomous PCAM programming workflow completed",
  "session_id": "pcam-1704326400000",
  "execution_summary": {
    "autonomous_mode": true,
    "safety_checks_passed": true,
    "operations_count": 5,
    "user_intervention_required": false
  },
  "project_analysis": {
    "dependencies_found": ["npm/node project detected"],
    "missing_files": [".gitignore"],
    "potential_improvements": ["Add .gitignore file"],
    "next_actions": ["npm install"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-04T00:00:00.000Z",
  "next_steps": [
    {
      "description": "Add .gitignore file", 
      "automated": true,
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Safety Override Response
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Autonomous execution not approved due to safety concerns",
  "reason": "PCAM analysis determined manual oversight required",
  "automation_confidence": 0.3,
  "recommended_action": "Please review the request and execute manually with appropriate safeguards"
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Extending Safe Commands
Add new command patterns to the `safeCommands` array in the "Autonomous Command Executor" node:

```javascript
const safeCommands = [
  // ... existing commands
  'your-safe-command',
  'another-safe-pattern'
];
```

### Adjusting Automation Confidence Threshold
Modify the confidence threshold in the "PCAM Decomposition Engine":

```javascript
// Current: proceeds when confidence > 0.5 (50%)
// Increase for higher safety: > 0.8 (80%)  
// Decrease for more automation: > 0.3 (30%)
proceed_autonomously: analysis.metrics.automation_confidence > 0.5
```

### Adding Language Support
Extend the `languagePatterns` object in "Project Structure Analyzer":

```javascript
const languagePatterns = {
  // ... existing patterns
  kotlin: ['.kt', '.kts'],
  swift: ['.swift'],
  dart: ['.dart']
};
```

## Security Considerations

### Audit Logging
- All operations are logged with timestamps
- Safety checks are recorded for compliance
- Execution results are preserved for analysis

### Network Security  
- No unauthorized network access
- Webhook endpoint should use HTTPS
- Consider IP whitelisting for production

### File System Protection
- Commands are sandboxed to project directory
- No system-level modifications allowed
- File integrity monitoring included

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Commands Not Executing**
   - Check if commands match approved safe patterns
   - Verify project path exists and is accessible
   - Review safety audit logs for blocked operations

2. **Low Automation Confidence**
   - Refine prompt with specific programming intentions
   - Avoid ambiguous or destructive language
   - Include clear project context

3. **Webhook Timeouts**
   - Complex projects may require longer execution time
   - Consider splitting large operations into smaller workflows
   - Monitor N8N execution limits

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding debug statements to Code nodes:

```javascript
console.log('Debug info:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
return [{json: {debug: true, ...result}}];
```

## Integration Examples

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
- name: Trigger Autonomous Programming
  run: |
    curl -X POST "${{ secrets.N8N_WEBHOOK_URL }}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"prompt": "Run tests and update documentation", "projectPath": "${{ github.workspace }}"}'
```

### VS Code Extension
```typescript
async function triggerAutonomousProgramming(prompt: string) {
  const response = await fetch(WEBHOOK_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt,
      projectPath: vscode.workspace.rootPath
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(result.message);
}
```
